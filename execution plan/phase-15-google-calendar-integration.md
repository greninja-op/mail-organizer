# Phase 15 — Google Calendar Integration

## Execution contract
Read requirements.md, spec.md, design.md and editor-rules.md first. Confirm this is the first incomplete phase. Inspect the actual repository before editing. Work only inside Mail Organizer; never modify sibling projects. Implement only this phase and do not execute later phases.

## Phase objective
Implement official Google Calendar API integration through a modular adapter. Reuse Google identity safely but request Calendar permission explicitly and minimally. Support calendar selection and event proposals from existing Action Engine and temporal intelligence. Require explicit confirmation, duplicate prevention, verified remote IDs, safe retries and honest failure/offline/auth handling. Do not full-sync calendars or mutate attendees automatically.

## Mandatory verification
- Build with the repository's official Gradle/KMP tooling.
- Run relevant automated tests and record real results.
- For Android, use ADB for install, launch, force-stop, logcat, dumpsys, screencap and screenrecord where relevant; use adb reverse only when genuinely required.
- Inspect runtime behavior, database state, errors and account boundaries where applicable.
- Perform visual QA against design.md, including dark mode, accessibility and empty/error/offline states.
- Fix failures and rebuild/reinstall/retest before completion.
- Never expose secrets or sensitive email content in logs.

## Documentation and stop condition
Update editor-rules.md with genuinely permanent new rules without deleting unrelated rules. Update spec.md only after verification. Record blockers as [!]; never fake completion. When this phase is verified, stop and do not implement the next phase.
