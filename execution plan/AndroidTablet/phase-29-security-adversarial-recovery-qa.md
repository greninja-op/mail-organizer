# Phase 29 — Security, Adversarial, Migration & Recovery QA

## MANDATORY PLATFORM ISOLATION — READ FIRST

This is an **Android tablet-only** phase. All tablet-specific source, resources, tests, configuration and documentation belong under `AndroidTablet/`. Never create or modify `Android/`, `iOS/`, `iPadOS/`, `macOS/`, `Windows/` or `Linux/`.

Shared KMP/Android business and data logic remains common. Do not duplicate common engines merely because the tablet UI differs.

## Mission

Dedicated hostile/recovery pass: malicious HTML/URLs, prompt injection, malformed Gmail responses, OAuth callback attacks, token/log leakage, cross-account access, DB corruption, migrations, interrupted sync, cursor gaps, process death, reboot, storage pressure, stale cache, notification privacy, account removal and partial external-action failures. Verify fail-closed behavior and data integrity. Feature expansion only for required fixes.

## Required execution protocol

Read the root execution instructions and all AndroidTablet master documents. Determine the first incomplete AndroidTablet phase and read only this prompt. Inspect the actual repository and previous evidence before implementation.

Implement **only this phase**. Do not begin later phases.

Run targeted automated tests, then Android tablet emulator validation and a physical tablet where available. Test relevant success, empty, loading, offline, error, cancellation, process-death and recovery states. For UI phases, test multiple widths/orientations and input modes. Perform relevant accessibility, security, data-integrity and performance checks.

Fix failures. Rebuild/reinstall/retest. Record exact commands and evidence. Update phase status and add only genuinely permanent new editor rules without deleting unrelated rules.

Never claim a test, screenshot, log, device result or performance measurement that was not actually performed.

**STOP AFTER PHASE 29.**
