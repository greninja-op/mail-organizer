# Phase 29 — Production OAuth / Play Store Preparation

## Execution contract
Read requirements.md, spec.md, design.md and editor-rules.md first. Confirm this is the first incomplete phase. Inspect the actual repository before editing. Work only inside Mail Organizer; never modify sibling projects. Implement only this phase and do not execute later phases.

## Phase objective
Prepare production OAuth and Play Store readiness. Verify package identity, release signing, variants, Google Cloud configuration, OAuth clients/fingerprints/consent/scopes, incremental authorization, Gmail/Calendar/Tasks production settings and optional AI configuration. Prepare privacy policy, Data Safety, account deletion, store metadata, screenshots, support and release notes. Build and inspect a release-like artifact and perform release smoke testing. Do not publish.

## Mandatory verification
- Build with the repository's official Gradle/KMP tooling.
- Run relevant automated tests and record real results.
- For Android, use ADB for install, launch, force-stop, logcat, dumpsys, screencap and screenrecord where relevant; use adb reverse only when genuinely required.
- Inspect runtime behavior, database state, errors and account boundaries where applicable.
- Perform visual QA against design.md, including dark mode, accessibility and empty/error/offline states.
- Fix failures and rebuild/reinstall/retest before completion.
- Never expose secrets or sensitive email content in logs.

## Documentation and stop condition
Update editor-rules.md with genuinely permanent new rules without deleting unrelated rules. Update spec.md only after verification. Record blockers as [!]; never fake completion. When this phase is verified, stop and do not implement the next phase.
